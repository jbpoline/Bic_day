Teaching fMRI
=============

Teaching fMRI
-------------

By JB Poline and Matthew Brett

Why - What - How
----------------

* Of the three - the why is the most important
* Of the three - the what is the one changing 
* Of the three - the how is the most delicate

Why ? 
==============

Why ?  
--------------

* We make fewer mistakes
* We work more efficiently
* We think more clearly - enabling to develop ideas
* We collaborate (much) better (and more efficiently)
* We allow other to build on our work


Mistakes
--------------------

The "Mistakes" argument : an unpopular topic.

- Ioannidis
- Annatomy of an Error
- The Left/Right issue
- The ADHD 1000 connectome

Efficiency
--------------------

The "Efficiency" argument: 

- How long to find out that there's a problem in the analysis ?
- Knowing your tools - knowning them well to progress rapidely
- learning the right tools : the difference between a 

Clarity / Enpowering
--------------------

* Knowing how to create the tools will free your mind for new ideas
* New tools are constantly emmerging - but they never are exactly what's needed


Collaboration
-------------

A new era for collaborative science

- specialization and rapid advances of science require collaboration
- collaborations are mostly "internet" - even if you are sitting next door
- new type of science at the frontiers of domains (eg: neurosynth, neurovault, brainspell, brainspell, neurobureau hackathon, etc)
- more or more open data - from post office to internet
- numpy competes with Matlab efficiently
- decreasing the social barriers to increase work 
- from social coding to social science ? from open source project to open source science ?
- is the era of close science giving away to the era of open science, as did software development?

Reproducibility
---------------

Building things such that they can be built upon

* Working such that my colleague can check my work

* Working such that the next post-doc will need less than a week to start progress

* Working such that others in the community can check / build upon

* Openness 

* Accountability


What?
=====

What?
-----

- Code / script development 
- Applied math
- The collaborative tools

Code / script development 
-------------------------

- The "Loni" fantasy
- The current tools : between brainvoyager and nipy ?
- I need to do scrubbing - but would like to downweight rather than eliminate
- Testing ? 
- Visualization 
- Some elements of distributed computing 

What - Applied math
--------------------

* Applied statistics 
* Signal processing
* Image analysis 
* Machine learning

The collaborative tools 
-----------------------

- For myself first - for others
- Git / Github / google docs (?) 

In the near future : 

- Semantic web technologies 
- Databasing  
- Datasharing techniques

How ?
=====

How ?
-----

- Find and make teaching material
- Motivate with practical analysis
- Feedback from our course

Find and make teaching material
-------------------------------

* Get the right material from online : many IP notebooks are available !
        - there is not enough time / teaching resources : some things must be learnt online. 

* Join forces with stat / CS / other departments 
        - development of courses that combine theoretical and coding aspects
        - BIDS

Motivate with practical analysis
--------------------------------

* Make the teaching close to the research project : real life after small exercices

* PNA experience
        - From a 10 * 2 hours to 23 * 2h + ...
        - about 30 IPython notebooks

What worked - what didn't  
------------------------------------

* We were young and ambitious 
        - underestimating the task
        -  
* We relied on students to have more background than they did  
* We often needed a lot of recap  
* The IPython notebook helped greatly
* Students with some reasonable background got something out of it
  others may be less :)
* Several courses with dependencies:
        - Shell / OS installs - Introduction to Python / IPython 
        - Toolbelt of the collaborative computational scientist / Workflow (Git, Github, ...)
        - Toolbelt of applied mathematics / statistics 
        - The analysis pipeline (preprocessing to GLM) [rely on others to teach GLM?]
        - Other Neuroimaging packages : ML / MV-Connectivity 

Conclusion
----------

* Make it so.
