Teaching fMRI
=============

Teaching fMRI
-------------

By JB Poline and Matthew Brett

Why - What - How
----------------

* Of the three - the why is the most important
* Of the three - the what is the one that evolves fastest 
* Of the three - the how is the most delicate

Why ? 
==============

Why ?  
--------------

* We make fewer mistakes
* We work more efficiently
* We think more clearly - enabling to develop ideas
* We collaborate better (and more efficiently)
* We allow other to build on our work


Mistakes
--------------------

The "Mistakes" argument : an unpopular topic.

- Ioannidis 2005
- Annatomy of an Error
- The Left/Right issue
- The ADHD 1000 connectome

.. Ioannidis : although many may not be convinced, the arguments are
.. Glenn Begley and Lee Ellis "Raise standards for preclinical cancer research" Nature 483 (2012)
.. L/R
.. scripts contained an error - new release

Efficiency
--------------------

The "Efficiency" argument: 


- Can I find out if there's a mistake?
- How long to find out that there's a problem in the analysis ?
- Knowing your tools - knowning them well to progress rapidely
- learning the right tools : the difference between walking or a good motorbike 

Clarity / Enpowering
--------------------

* Knowing how to create the tools will free your mind for new ideas. 
* New tools are constantly emmerging - but they never are exactly what's needed
* Constructing the tool may take time - it will save some. 

.. Again : we need to empower students and researcher with the freedom to analyse the data the way they want, rather than having to re-use scripts and be constraint by those

Collaboration
-------------

A new era for collaborative science

- *Specialization* and rapid advances of science require *collaboration*
- Collaborations today are mostly "internet" 
- Internet collaborations allow a new type of science
    * neurosynth, neurovault, brainspell, brainspell, neurobureau hackathon, etc
    * shared tools and data are growing fast 
    * decreasing the social barriers and increase work 
- from social coding to social science ? from open source project to open source science ?

.. more or more open data - from post office to internet
.. numpy competes with Matlab efficiently
.. is the era of close science giving away to the era of open science, as did software development?
.. bitkeeper from Sun // Linus Torvald git 
.. example of analysis done with a chineese statistician
.. data being reviewed : nature initiative

Reproducibility
---------------

Building things such that they can be built upon

* Accountability
    - Working such that the next post-doc will need less than a week to start progress 
    - Working such that others in the community can check / build upon

* Openness 
    -  Working such that my colleague can check my work



What?
=====

What?
-----

- Code / script development 
- Applied math
- The collaborative tools

Code / script development 
-------------------------

- The "Loni" fantasy
- The current tools : between brainvoyager (closed) and nipy (require programation skill) ?
- I need to do scrubbing - but would like to downweight rather than eliminate
- Testing ? 
- Visualization 
- Some elements of distributed computing 

What - Applied math
--------------------

* Applied statistics 
* Signal processing
* Image analysis 
* Machine learning
* Graph Theory  

The collaborative tools 
-----------------------

- For myself first - for others
- Git / Github / google docs  

In the near future : 

- Semantic web technologies 
- Databasing and Datasharing techniques

How ?
=====

How ?
-----

- Find and make teaching material
- Motivate with practical analysis
- Feedback from our course

Find and make teaching material
-------------------------------

* Get the right material from online, many IP notebooks are available !
        - there is not enough time / teaching resources : some things must be learnt online. 

* Join forces with stat / CS / other departments 
        - development of courses that combine theoretical and coding aspects
        - BIDS


Motivate with practical analysis
--------------------------------

* Make the teaching close to the research project
* Spend enough time that programing an analysis will be a confort zone

* PNA experience
        - From a 10 * 2 hours to 27 * 2h + ...
        - 47 IPython notebooks


What worked - what didn't  
------------------------------------


* We were young and ambitious 
    - underestimating the task + goal too broad 
* We relied on students to have more background than they did  

* The IPython notebook helped greatly
* Details : curse and blessing - more curse than blessing

What kind of curriculum ? 
------------------------------------

* Several courses with dependencies:
        - Shell / OS installs - Introduction to Python / IPython 
        - Toolbelt of the collaborative computational scientist / Workflow (Git, Github, ...)
        - Toolbelt of applied mathematics / statistics 
        - The analysis pipeline (preprocessing to GLM) [rely on others to teach GLM?]
        - Other Neuroimaging packages : ML / MV-Connectivity 

.. two first components should be taught by BIDS
.. # 3 could be in conjunction with stat / engineering / neuroscience
.. 4 and 5 really specific

Conclusion
----------

* Make it so.  What kind of teachers ?
