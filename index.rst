Teaching FMRI
=============

Why - What - How
================

* Of the three - the why is the most important
* Of the three - the what is the one changing 
* Of the three - the how is the most delicate

Why?
====

* We make fewer mistakes
* We work more efficiently
* We think more clearly
* We collaborate better
* We allow other to build on our work

Mistakes
========

* Ioannidis
* Anatomy of an Error
* The Left/Right issue
* The ADHD 1000 connectome

Efficiency
==========

* How long to find out that there's a problem in the analysis ?
* Knowing your tools - knowing them well enough to work quickly and without
  mistakes
* learning the right tools : the difference between a 

Clarity
=======

* Knowing how to create the tools will free your mind for new ideas
* New tools are constantly emerging - but they never are exactly what's needed

Collaboration
=============

A new era for collaborative science

* specialization and rapid advances of science require collaboration
* collaborations are mostly "internet" - even if you are sitting next door
* new type of science at the frontiers of domains (eg: neurosynth, neurovault,
  neurobureau hackathon, etc)

Reproducibility
===============

Building things such that they can be built upon

* Working such that my colleague can check my work
* Working such that the next post-doc will need less than a week to start
  progress
* Working such that others in the community can check / build upon

What?
=====

Code / script development
=========================

* The "Loni" fantasy
* The current state is from bad to mixed : between Brainvoyager and nipy ?
* eg : I need to do scrubbing - but would like to down-weight rather than
  eliminate

Things we need to master
========================

* Applied statistics / signal processing / image analysis / machine learning
* the collaborative tools 
    * for myself - for others
    * git / github / Google docs (?)
* Some element of distributed computing 
* visualization
* In the near future : Semantic web technologies ? Databasing ? Datasharing techniques?

How ?
=====

Find and make teaching material
===============================

* Get the right material from online : many IP notebooks are available !
        - there is not enough time / teaching resources : some things must be learnt online. 

Find common ground with others
==============================

* Join forces with stat / CS / other departments 
        - development of courses that combine theoretical and coding aspects
        - BIDS

Motivate with practical analysis
================================

* Make the teaching close to the research project : real life after small
  exercises
* PNA experience

Conclusion
==========

* Make it so.
