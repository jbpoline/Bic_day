Teaching fMRI
=============

Why - What - How
----------------

* Of the three - the why is the most important
* Of the three - the what is the one changing 
* Of the three - the how is the most delicate

Why
---

* The "Mistakes" argument : an unpopular topic.
        - Ioannidis
        - Annatomy of an Error
        - The Left/Right issue
        - The ADHD 1000 connectome

* The "Efficiency" argument: 
        - How long to find out that there's a problem in the analysis ?
        - Knowing your tools - knowning them well to progress rapidely
        - learning the right tools : the difference between a 

* Knowing how to create the tools will free your mind for new ideas
        - New tools are constantly emmerging - but they never are exactly what's needed

* A new era for collaborative science
        - specialization and rapid advances of science require collaboration
        - collaborations are mostly "internet" - even if you are sitting next door
        - new type of science at the frontiers of domains (eg: neurosynth, neurovault, neurobureau hackathon, etc)

* Building things such that they can be built upon
        - Working such that my colleague can check my work
        - Working such that the next post-doc will need less than a week to start progress
        - Working such that others in the community can check / build upon

* Reproducibility 

What
----

* Code / script development 
        - The "Loni" fantasy
        - The current state is from bad to mixed : between brainvoyager and nipy ?
        - eg : I need to do scrubbing - but would like to downweight rather than eliminate

* Applied statistics / signal processing / image analysis / machine learning
        - 

* the collaborative tools 
        - for myself - for others
        - git / github / google docs (?) 

* Some element of distributed computing 

* visualisation 

* In the near future : Semantic web technologies ? Databasing ? Datasharing techniques?


How ?
-----

* Get the right material from online : many IP notebooks are available !
        - there is not enough time / teaching resources : some things must be learnt online. 

* Join forces with stat / CS / other departments 
        - development of courses that combine theoretical and coding aspects
        - BIDS

* Make the teaching close to the research project : real life after small exercices

* PNA experience
